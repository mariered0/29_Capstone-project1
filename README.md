# Capstone-project 1: Booklyn



Please check out my project: [Booklyn](https://booklyn-app.herokuapp.com/)


## OVERVIEW
Booklyn is a digital book shelf where users can label books they want to read, are currently reading, have read, or favorite and they can leave reviews on the books.
## GOALS
1. Users will be able to keep track of which books they wanted to read and have read as well as what they felt when they read.
2. Help people read or access more books that interest them by the social media aspect of this app.

## USER DEMOGRAPHIC
People who like to read, want to share their thoughts about books or see other people's reviews on books.

## DATA SOURCE
Data will be sourced from the following:
- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)

    
Book cover images are provided through their API as well as other information such as book titles, subtitles, authors, genre, publisher and average user ratings.
